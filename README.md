### Constellation Drawing with Poems

For my Final Project I will be doing art accompanied by poetry about the different constellations, specifically zodiac signs. I will be animating the text of the poems as well as the actual zodiac svg's which I will be making on my own. I hope to include a unique svg image for each of the zodiac signs I choose which will be animated using the css stroke-dasharray attribute. With each svg having its own individual circles, I also hope to implement blinking animations. I will be following the established constellation forms for each zodiac, with slight changes made to them if possible. I want to treat each zodiac as a separate entity, with a personality based on the traits associated. This will be reflected in the poems, which will start appearing once the user hovers over the svg. To add a bit more life to each page, I hope to create individual character images for each zodiac as well, perhaps with some sort of blinking animation or dasharray animation to add more light to each screen. If possible, I would also like to include a particle system with stars blinking as my main menu page. Overall, Sound would also be important for my project, as I would like to add a bit more atmospheric ambiance being that I currently do not have any sound implemented. It would be different for each zodiac and would hopefully match the personality traits of each as well.
